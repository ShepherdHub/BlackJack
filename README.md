Goals
-----

This is a learning project. I will be focusing on learning concepts like error handling, dependency management through separating the business layer from the presentation layer, TDD, and the C## language.


Current Rules
-------------

The first iteration will be a simplified version of Black Jack with one active player and no betting. The "dealer" in this game is the computer. The winner of a round collects all cards played that round in their winnings. In the spirit of vegas, round ties favor the dealer. The game continues until all cards are dealt. When all cards have been dealt, the winner of the game is determined by counting the number of cards in each player's winnings. The final result of the game can be a tie.
